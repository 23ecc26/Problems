The Square root of a number x lies between 0 and x/2(inclusive) for x>2

We can find the sqrt of a number using binary search when there is a constrain that we should not use the inbuild function

class Solution {
  public int mySqrt(int x) {
    if (x < 2)
      return x; // return x if it is 0 or 1
    int left = 2, right = x / 2; 
    int mid;
    long num; 
    while (left <= right) {    // binary search for the square root
      mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
      num = (long) mid * mid;
      if (num > x)
        right = mid - 1;  // if mid * mid is greater than x, set right to mid - 1
      else if (num < x)
        left = mid + 1;  // if mid * mid is less than x, set left to mid + 1
      else
        return mid;     // if mid * mid is equal to x, return mid
    }
    return right;
  }
