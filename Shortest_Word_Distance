You are given:

An array of strings: wordsDict, e.g. ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"] 
Leetcode
+1

Two distinct target words: word1 and word2, both guaranteed to exist somewhere in the array. 
LeetCode
+1

You need to return the shortest distance between these two words in the array. Distance is defined as the absolute difference between their indices. That is: if word1 occurs at index i, and word2 occurs at index j, the distance is |i − j|.

Because the same word might occur multiple times, there may be multiple positions of word1 and word2 — you must consider all possible pairs and return the minimum distance across all



class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(String[] wordsDict, String word1, String word2) {
        int index1 = -1;
        int index2 = -1;
        int minDist = wordsDict.length;  // initial large value

        for (int i = 0; i < wordsDict.length; i++) {
            if (wordsDict[i].equals(word1)) {
                index1 = i;
                if (index2 != -1) {
                    minDist = Math.min(minDist, Math.abs(index1 - index2));
                }
            }
            if (wordsDict[i].equals(word2)) {
                index2 = i;
                if (index1 != -1) {
                    minDist = Math.min(minDist, Math.abs(index1 - index2));
                }
            }
        }
        return minDist;
    }
}
